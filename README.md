Title - Converging Worlds

Short Abstract
I will be making an algorithmic video using various algorithms to generate abstract visuals along with the soundtrack. This visual will be midi reactive. I will create several sketches to segment different parts and sounds giving it different variations and types of visual textures. This piece will evoke a sense of suspense as well as a sense of calm at certain points, pulling the viewer in and out of a space. 

Reference

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55QU470oWrM - Ryoichi Kurokawa 
This reference from Ryoichi Kurokawa is relevant to my work because he uses a line in the middle of the visual seperating it into two parts. The glitches are also relevant in what i want to achieve in my visuals. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWPO7tXWVhc - AOKI takamasa // rhythm variation 05
This reference is relevant in my work because in the sketch, there are two similiar visuals going on at the same time side by side, even though there is no clear line separating the two, it is very similiar to what i want to  do in my video. 


This soundtrack will be 2:20secs. The genre is ambient/experimental/glitch.
